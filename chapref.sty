% Chaprefs.sty - Style file to produce Reference sections on a per
%                Chapter bases (using BibTeX)

%=======================================================================
 
%
% Define two variables:
%       \bib@sty        - Holds the selected bibliography style
%       \bib@name       - Holds the name of the current \include file
%
 
\def\bib@sty{plane}
\def\bib@name{\jobname}
 
%
% Redefine \include to save the name of the included file in the variable
% \bib@name.  This definition simply extends the LaTeX definition by
% redefining \include to call \@include, this is taken from the \include
% definition in LaTeX.TeX
%
 
\def\include#1{\include@#1 }
\def\include@#1 {\def\bib@name{#1}\@include#1 }
 
%
% Define a new `Preamble' flag to indicate chapter reference are required.
% This is required as the contents of the .aux files is diferent dependent
% on the state of this flag.
%
% The flag is initilay set to false.  Ie., do not produce chapter reference,
% but do produce a bibliography chapter.
%
% The preable command \chaprefs is defined to switch the flag to true.  Ie.,
% produce chapter reference, but not a bibliography chapter.
%
 
\newif\if@chpref \@chpreffalse
\def\chaprefs{\@chpreftrue}
 
%
% Redefine \bibliographystyle to save the selected style in the variable
% \bib@sty.  This will be ouput to the .aux file for each included file.
% Hence only one \bibliographystyle command is required.
%
 
\def\bibliographystyle#1{
    \if@filesw\immediate\write\@auxout{\string\bibstyle{#1}}\fi
    \def\bib@sty{#1}
}
 
%
% Redefine \bibliography to use new factoring of the command.
% It redefineds the constant \@Ref as used in \thebiblography to add a
% "References" section, such that it now adds a "Biblography" chapter.
%
 
\def\bibliography#1{\if@filesw\immediate\write\@auxout{\string\bibdata{#1}}
         \def\@Ref{\@bib} \@input{\jobname.bbl} \fi }
 
%
% define \references to write the \bibstyle and \bibdata commands to the
% current .aux file.  It then inputs the current .bbl file if it exists.
%
 
\def\references#1{\if@filesw\if@chpref\immediate\write\@auxout
         {\string\bibstyle{\bib@sty}} \write\@auxout{\string\bibdata{#1}}
         \fi \@input{\bib@name.bbl} \fi }
 
%
% Define two functions:
%       \@Ref to add a "References" section to the current % chapter.
%       \@bib to add a "Bibliography" chapter to the document.
%
% It is assumed that the bibliography will be at the end of the document.
% Ie., no \references commands are given after the \bibliography command.
%
 
\def\@Ref{\section{References}}
\def\@bib{\chapter*{Bibliography\@mkboth{BIBLIOGRAPHY}{BIBLIOGRAPHY}}
         \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography} }
 
%
% At the start of a .bbl file is the command \thebibliography.  This has
% been modified to add a "References" section to the current chapter.  Note,
% the definition of \thebibliography is taken from the ucthesis document
% style.
%
% When the \bibliography command is used the definition of \@Ref is altered
% to add a "Bibliography" chapter.  This definition is not changed back,
% thus the \bibliography command must only be given after all \references
% commands have been processed.
%
 
\def\thebibliography#1{\@Ref\list{[\arabic{enumi}]}
    {\settowidth\labelwidth{[#1]}\leftmargin\labelwidth
    \advance\leftmargin\labelsep
    \usecounter{enumi}}
    \def\newblock{\hskip .11em plus .33em minus .07em}
