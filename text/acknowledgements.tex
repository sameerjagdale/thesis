I am thankful to my supervisor, Prof. Laurie Hendren, whose help and encouragement has made this thesis possible. It is because of her that I will graduate from the Master's program with a greater understanding  of compilers as well as a greater respect for them . 

I would also like to thank Rahul Garg, who developed the Velociraptor framework on which this research relies heavily upon. Moreover, I would like to thank him for suggesting this line of research and for mentoring me throughout the course of my research. 

Additionally, I would like to thank Vineet Kumar, Ismail Badawi and Xu Li who helped me understand the \mclab framework as well as Erick Lavoie and Vincent Foley-Bourgon who helped translate the abstract in French. I would also like to thank my other labmates, Sujay Kathrotia, Faiz Khan, Andrew Bodzay and Lei Lopez who made working in a lab fun. 

I would also  like to thank my parents and my brother, who never stopped supporting me and without whom I would not be where I am today. 

Finally, I would like to thank the wonderful city of Montreal, whose beauty and people have made my Master's experience magical and memorable.
