An important contribution of the thesis is the static generation of C++ code from VRIR. Due to differences in the semantics of VRIR and C++, we faced various challenges during code generation. As described in \chapref{chap:Background}, VRIR is a high level strongly typed AST designed to support easy compilation of a wide range of Array based languages. Hence, it supports different indexing schemes such as 0-indexing, 1-indexing and negative indexing as well as different array layout schemes such as row-major and column-major. C++ on the other hand does not have an in-built support for arrays, and only supports 0-indexing and a row major layout. Moreover, VRIR also supports multiple returns. On the other hand, we can only return a single value, which can be a scalar, class, struct or a pointer, in C++. This chapter describes in detail the challenges of compiling from VRIR to C++ and  how different nodes in VRIR are mapped to C++ constructs including those which C++ does not implicitly support.
\section{Mapping types}
\subsection{VRIR types}
Types in VRIR can be categorised into 5 types :
\subsection{Scalar type}
The scalar type is used define the primitive data type.
Different types of Scalar values are
